## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cards` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cards, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/cards>.

## IEX

On Windows iex is PowerShell aligned, so we need to use `iex.bet` instead of `iex`. In the root of the project exeucte

> `iex -S mix`

This opens Elixir in Interactive mode. You can call functions in modules such as `Cards.create_deck`. If you've changed the source code, execute `recompile` to have the new code reflected in the environment.
